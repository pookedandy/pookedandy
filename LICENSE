                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) [2025]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software
and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
all versions of a program—so that it becomes free software for all
its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other work that we release as free software.

You can apply it to your own programs, too.  When we speak of
free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  To protect
your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, can
change the software and share it.  In addition, you must keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty.  Also, you must provide a copy of this
License along with the program.

If you modify the program, you must distribute your modified
version under the same license, so that it also remains free for
everyone to use.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copy-
left, the right to make your modifications and use them, and (2)
our guarantee that you will be treated fairly.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
  
     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.
  
     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
     this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Copy",
     "copying", "modified", "modifying", and "modification" are to
     be interpreted broadly in this License.

  1. Source Code.
  
     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
     work for making modifications to it.  For example, if the
     program is written in a programming language, then the source
     code is the text of the program in that language, and any
     associated files and libraries needed to build it.  If the
     program is an interactive user interface, the source code might
     be scripts or markup.

  2. Basic Permissions.
  
     You may copy, modify, and distribute the Program, including
     the modified versions, provided that you comply with the terms
     of this License.  This includes the right to use the Program
     in a nonprofit or for-profit context, but remember that if you
     distribute the Program (or modified versions), you must make
     the source code available under the same GPL license.

  3. Copyleft.
  
     This section is a key part of the GPL.  It ensures that the
     software remains free for everyone.  If you modify the Program
     and distribute it, you must do so under the same terms—specifically,
     you must distribute the modified version under the GPL v3.0.

  4. No Warranty.
  
     The Program is distributed with the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

  5. Termination.
  
     You may not use, copy, distribute, or modify the Program except
     as expressly provided for under this License.  If you violate
     any part of this License, your rights under it will be
     automatically terminated, unless the violation is cured within 30
     days.

  6. Acceptance.
  
     By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Program (or
     any work based on the Program), you are agreeing to be bound by
     the terms of this License.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
